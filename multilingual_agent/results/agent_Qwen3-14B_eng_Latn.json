Additionally, tropical regions often have dense vegetation that contributes to transpiration (plant-based evaporation). The warm, moist air near the surface rises, cools, and condenses, creating frequent rainfall cycles. This cycle maintains high humidity levels. Finally, proximity to warm ocean currents and the lack of cold air masses to reduce moisture content also contribute to persistent humidity. \n\nSince this is a general meteorological question, I cannot use the provided tools to answer it directly.
