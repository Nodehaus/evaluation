            "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking about the weather in London next Friday. Let me figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the date for next Friday. The user didn't specify a date, just \"next Friday,\" so I should find out what that date is. The get_current_date function can help me get today's date. Once I have today's date, I can calculate next Friday's date. \n\nWait, but the get_current_date function returns the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Let's say today is Wednesday, October 18, 2023. Then next Friday would be October 20, 2023. But I need to make sure I calculate it correctly regardless of the current day. However, maybe the function can be called to get the current date, then I can compute the days until next Friday. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find the next Friday's date based on the current date. But since I can't perform date calculations myself, I need to use the get_current_date function first to find out today's date, then figure out next Friday's date from there. \n\nOnce I have the date for next Friday, I can use the weather_forecast function with the city as London and the date as the calculated next Friday's date. \n\nSo the steps are: \n1. Call get_current_date to find today's date.\n2. Determine next Friday's date based on today's date.\n3. Call weather_forecast with city: London and date: next Friday's date.\n\nBut wait, the user might be asking for the next upcoming Friday, which could be in the next week. So if today is Friday, then next Friday would be a week later. But if today is Saturday, next Friday is in six days. Hmm, but the exact calculation might be complex. However, the user just said \"next Friday,\" so perhaps the assistant needs to find the next occurrence of Friday after today. \n\nBut since I can't perform date calculations, I need to first get the current date, then compute the next Friday. However, the assistant's tools don't include a date calculation function, only get_current_date. Therefore, after getting the current date, I would need to manually compute the next Friday's date. For example, if today is 2023-10-18 (Wednesday), then next Friday is 2023-10-20. But how to do that programmatically? Since the assistant can't do that, maybe the user expects that the assistant will handle it, but in the context of the tool calls, perhaps the assistant can call get_current_date, then determine the next Friday's date based on that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's question is straightforward, and the assistant can assume that \"next Friday\" is the upcoming Friday, so the assistant can call get_current_date, then add the necessary days to reach the next Friday. However, since the assistant can't perform date math, perhaps the assistant needs to call get_current_date first, then based on the current date, compute the next Friday's date. \n\nBut in the context of this problem, the assistant is supposed to call the functions. So the first step is to call get_current_date to get today's date. Once that's done, the assistant can figure out next Friday's date. However, since the assistant can't perform date calculations, maybe the assistant is expected to call the get_current_date function, then use that date to compute the next Friday. But since the assistant can't do that, perhaps the user's question is to be answered by first getting the current date, then using that to determine the next Friday's date. \n\nBut given the tools available, the assistant can only call get_current_date and then use that to find the next Friday. However, in the absence of a date calculation function, perhaps the assistant is supposed to proceed by first getting the current date, then assuming that next Friday is 7 days from today if today is Friday, otherwise, it's the next occurrence. But this is getting complicated. \n\nIn any case, the first step is to call get_current_date to get the current date. Then, based on that date, compute the next Friday. Once the date is determined, call the weather_forecast function with London and that date. \n\nSo, the first tool call should be to get_current_date. Then, after receiving that date, compute the next Friday's date. However, since the assistant can't perform date calculations, maybe the user's question is intended to be handled by first getting the current date, then using that to find the next Friday. But for the purpose of this exercise, perhaps the assistant is supposed to call get_current_date first, then proceed to call the weather_forecast function with the next Friday's date. \n\nTherefore, the first"

This creates a cycle where moist air rises, cools, and forms clouds or rain, but the continuous warmth and abundant water sources maintain high humidity even when it's not actively raining. The proximity to equatorial climates also means frequent cloud cover and precipitation, further contributing to the sensation of humidity."
