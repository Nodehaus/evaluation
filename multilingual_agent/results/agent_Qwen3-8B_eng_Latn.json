            "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking about the weather in Vancouver this Sunday. Let me figure out how to handle this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the date for this Sunday. Since the current date isn't provided, I should use the get_current_date function to find today's date. Once I have today's date, I can calculate what date this Sunday falls on. For example, if today is Wednesday, adding 4 days would get to Sunday. But wait, maybe the user is referring to the upcoming Sunday. So, I need to check the current date, then find the next Sunday's date. \n\nWait, the user might be asking for the weather on the next Sunday. So, after getting today's date, I can compute the date of the next Sunday. Let me think: if today is, say, October 5th (a Wednesday), then next Sunday is October 13th. But if today is Sunday, then it's this Sunday. So the function needs to get the current date, then determine the correct date for \"this Sunday\".\n\nBut how do I compute that? Well, the get_current_date function gives me today's date. Then I can calculate the number of days until next Sunday. For example, if today is Wednesday, 4 days until Sunday. If today is Sunday, then it's 0 days. But if today is Monday, then 6 days until next Sunday. Wait, no: if today is Monday, the next Sunday is 6 days later? Wait, Monday to Sunday is 6 days? Wait, Monday to Tuesday is +1, ..., Sunday is +6 days. So yes. So once I have today's date, I can compute the next Sunday's date by adding the appropriate number of days.\n\nBut since the user is asking for \"this Sunday\", which could be the upcoming one, I need to calculate that. However, the function weather_forecast requires a specific date. So once I have the correct date for this Sunday, I can call the weather_forecast function with Vancouver and that date.\n\nSo the steps are: first, get the current date. Then calculate the date of this Sunday. Then call weather_forecast with city Vancouver and that date.\n\nBut how to compute the date of this Sunday? Well, the current date is in YYYY-MM-DD format. Let's say today is 2023-10-05 (Wednesday). Then this Sunday would be 2023-10-08. Wait, no: October 5th is Wednesday, so October 8th is Saturday? Wait, no. Let me check. Let's take an example. If today is October 5th, 2023 (Wednesday), then the next Sunday is October 8th? Wait, October 5th is Wednesday, 6th is Thursday, 7th Friday, 8th Saturday, 9th Sunday. Oh right, so adding 4 days to Wednesday would get to Sunday. Wait, Wednesday + 4 days is Sunday. So if today is Wednesday, next Sunday is 4 days later. So the calculation is: current date, find the day of the week, then compute how many days until next Sunday. For example, if today is Sunday, then it's 0 days. If today is Monday, 6 days until next Sunday. So the code would need to calculate that, but since I'm a bot, I can't do that. Wait, but the functions provided don't include a date calculation function. So how can I compute the date of this Sunday?\n\nWait, the user is asking for \"this Sunday\". So perhaps the current date is today, and \"this Sunday\" refers to the upcoming one. But without knowing the current date, I can't compute it. Therefore, I need to first get the current date using get_current_date. Then, based on that, calculate the next Sunday's date. However, since I can't perform date calculations, maybe I can use the current date to determine the day of the week and then compute the days until next Sunday. But since the functions don't provide that, maybe the user expects me to use the current date and then add days accordingly. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is asking for the weather on the next Sunday, so I need to get the current date, then compute the next Sunday's date. But since I can't perform that calculation, perhaps the user expects me to use the current date and then add days. Wait, but I can't do that without knowing the current date. So the steps are:\n\n1. Call get_current_date to get today's date.\n2. Determine the date of this Sunday based on today's date.\n3. Call weather_forecast with Vancouver and that date.\n\nBut how to determine the date of this Sunday? Well, the current date is given"
