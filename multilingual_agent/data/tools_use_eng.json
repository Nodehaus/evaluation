Cities like Denver experience unique weather patterns due to the Rocky Mountains nearby. Would you like me to check the current weather conditions in any mountainous region?"

When air heats up, it becomes less dense and rises, creating low pressure areas. Cooler, denser air then moves in to fill that space, creating wind. The Earth's rotation also affects wind patterns through the Coriolis effect. Local factors like mountains, bodies of water, and urban heat islands can create their own wind patterns too.

Each snowflake forms under slightly different atmospheric conditions as it falls - different temperatures, humidity levels, and air currents create unique crystal patterns. The more complex the snowflake, the less likely it is to be duplicated. However, simple snow crystals might occasionally be similar. Wilson Bentley, who photographed thousands of snowflakes in the early 1900s, never found two that were exactly alike. If you're curious about snowy weather conditions in any particular city, I'd be happy to check that for you!"
