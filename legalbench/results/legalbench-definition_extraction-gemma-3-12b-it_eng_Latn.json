A \u201cuse\u201d is \u201c[t]he act of employing a thing for any ... purpose.\u201d 19 Oxford English Dictionary 350 (2d ed. 1989). To \u201cuse\u201d something, in other words, is to employ the thing for its instrumental value,\u00a0i.e.,\u00a0to employ the thing to accomplish a further goal. See\u00a0United States v.

A \u201cuse,\u201d therefore, is an inherently intentional act\u2014that is, an act done for the purpose of causing certain consequences or at least with knowledge that those consequences will ensue. See\u00a0Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 8A, p. 15 (1965)\u00a0(defining intentional acts).\nTerm:",
