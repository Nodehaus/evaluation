Black's Law Dictionary 1110 (8th ed. 2004) (Black's) (\u201cA violation of the law; a crime, often a minor one. See CRIME\u201d); id., at 1232 (4th ed. 1951) (\u201cA crime or misdemeanor; a breach of the criminal laws\u201d); id., at 1282 (3d ed. 1933) (same). The 1942 edition of Webster's similarly states that \u201coffense\u201d \u201chas no technical legal meaning; but it is sometimes used specifically for an indictable crime ... and sometimes for a misdemeanor or wrong punishable only by fine or penalty.\u201d Webster's New International Dictionary 1690 (2d ed.). See also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1566 (1976) (Webster's Third) (\u201can infraction of law: CRIME, MISDEMEANOR\u201d); American Heritage Dictionary 1255 (3d ed. 1992) (\u201cA transgression of law; a crime\u201d). It is true that the term \u201coffense\u201d is sometimes used more broadly. For instance, the 1948 edition of Ballentine's Law Dictionary cautions: \u201cThe words \u2018crime\u2019 and \u2018offense\u2019 are not necessarily synonymous. All crimes are offenses, but some offenses are not crimes.\u201d Ballentine's Law Dictionary 900.\nLabel:",

A \u201cuse\u201d is \u201c[t]he act of employing a thing for any ... purpose.\u201d 19 Oxford English Dictionary 350 (2d ed. 1989). To \u201cuse\u201d something, in other words, is to employ the thing for its instrumental value,\u00a0i.e.,\u00a0to employ the thing to accomplish a further goal. See\u00a0United States v.

A \u201cuse,\u201d therefore, is an inherently intentional act\u2014that is, an act done for the purpose of causing certain consequences or at least with knowledge that those consequences will ensue. See\u00a0Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 8A, p. 15 (1965)\u00a0(defining intentional acts).\nLabel:",

The Oxford English Dictionary (OED), surveying the history of the word, notes that Edward Hall, a famous 16th-century legal scholar and author of Hall's Chronicle, wrote: \u201cA traytor ... is apprehended and deteigned in prisone for his offence,\u201d a use of the word, as we know from Blackstone, that is consistent with bail. See\u00a0supra,\u00a0at 863 \u2013 864 OED (3d ed., Dec. 2012), http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/51176 (annot. to def. 1). David Hume, the famous 18th-century historian and philosopher, writes of being \u201cdetained in strict confinement,\u201d thereby implying the existence of detention without strict confinement.\u00a0Ibid.\u00a0A 19th-century novelist writes, \u201c \u2018Beg your pardon, sir,\u2019 said the constable, ... \u2018I shall be obliged to detain you till this business is settled\u2019 \u201d\u2014again a use of \u201cdetain\u201d that we know (from Blackstone) is consistent with bail.\u00a0Ibid.\u00a0And the OED concludes that the primary meaning of \u201cdetain\u201d is \u201c[t]o keep in confinement\u00a0or under restraint\u00a0; to keep prisoner.\u201d\u00a0Ibid.\u00a0(emphasis added).\u00a0\nLabel:",
