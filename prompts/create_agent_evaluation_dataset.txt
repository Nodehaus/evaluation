I want to create an evaluation for agentic tool use. Add a file `multilingual_agent/data/tools_use_eng.json` that contains 50 example conversation. Generate 50 full LLM conversations in English, 5 of them that do not require tool use, 20 that mention a specific date and a city for tool use and 25 that mention a relative date ("today", "next saturday" etc.) for tool use in two steps (first tool to get current date and then tool to get weather for a specific date and a place). You can find the agent that we want to evaluate in `multilingual_agent/agent.py`, it has two tools available to get the current date and get the weather for a place and specific date. It supports a list of cities that you can use in your data and it calculate the weather information with a deterministic algorithm, use those weather data in your conversation. The conversation that you create must be in the same format as the agent would return and we would store them in JSON. You cannot run the agent.
